							<p style="text-shadow: -1px -1px 0 black, 1px -1px 0 black, -1px 1px 0 black, 1px 1px 0 black; color: white;">The UPLB Edible Landscaping team strongly believes that edible landscaping can play a vital role in promoting a greener and healthier lifestyle for Filipinos. With the slogan "No Filipino should be hungry," the team sees edible landscaping as a means to address hunger while encouraging sustainable practices. Edible landscaping involves growing organic vegetables, fruits, herbs, and medicinal plants within landscaping designs, offering the benefits of fresh and chemical-free produce. By integrating edible plants into traditional landscaping, Filipinos can enhance their access to nutritious food and contribute to environmental sustainability.</p>
